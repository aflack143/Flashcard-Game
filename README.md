# Flashcard-Game

Thank you for playing my 1st game creation. My inspiration for this game is my 2 children, and their love for playing card games as a family.

Within this game I will demonstrate the skills I have learned from the General Assemb.ly (GA) program, using HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

    o	Or something similar to when playing solitaire – will need to look up good scoring methods
